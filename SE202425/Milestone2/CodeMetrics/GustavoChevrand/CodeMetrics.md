# Code Metrics Analysis

## 1. Weighted Methods per Class 

Class: EditSession.java

Value: 397

Reference value: [0..12)

The Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) metric, a software measurement in object-oriented programming, quantifies the complexity of a class by summing the complexities of its methods. Each method within a class is assigned a weight, typically based on its individual complexity measured using metrics like cyclomatic complexity. A higher value indicates a more complex class, which may be more challenging to comprehend, maintain, and test. It also suggests potential issues like code bloat or poor cohesion, prompting the need for refactoring. 

The value 397 suggests that the EditSession class is highly complex and presents a significant challenge in the process of refactoring.

## 2. Number of Parameters

Method: fillXZ(BlockVector3 origin, B block, double radius, int depth, boolean recursive);

Located in Class: EditSession.java

Value: 5

Reference value: [0..3)

This metric suggests a substantial number of parameters, which may imply a high level of complexity associated with the method, leading to increased cognitive load for developers who must understand and remember the purpose and order of each parameter. Furthermore, it implies an increased maintainability cost due to the heightened risk of errors in parameter usage, challenges in refactoring the method without affecting multiple parts of the codebase, and difficulties in testing all parameter combinations thoroughly. This complexity can also result in potential usability challenges, as methods with many parameters can be less intuitive and harder to use correctly, potentially deterring developers from utilizing the method effectively and impacting the overall readability and quality of the code.

## 3. Condition Nesting Depth

Method: redo(EditSession editSession);

Value: 0

Reference value: [0..2)

This metric measures the depth of nested control structures, i.e, how many levels of nested conditional statements and loops exist within the method or function. A higher value implies more intricate code, which can be more challenging to comprehend, maintain, and read. Conversely, a lower nesting depth indicates simpler and more straightforward code.

In this particular case, there's no nesting, which makes the code easier to understand.
