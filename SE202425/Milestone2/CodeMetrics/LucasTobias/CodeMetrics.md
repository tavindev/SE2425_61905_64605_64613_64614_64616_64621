### Metrics Collected of FabricWorld


## Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) - Class Level: 92 Regular[0..12]
The WMC measures the complexity of a class by adding up the complexities of its methods. A higher value indicates a more complex class, which can be more challenging to understand, maintain and test. It also suggests possible problems such as code bloat or low cohesion, indicating the need for refactoring. Which is very much the case with the FabricWorld class.

## Cognitive Complexity Calculation (G. Ann Metrics Set): 4 Regular[0..8] of method: createEntity
Cognitive complexity is a measure of how difficult it is to understand a piece of code. It takes into account various factors, such as the number of nested loops, conditionals and other control flow structures. A higher value indicates more complex code. A value of 4 is considered low, indicating that the createEntity method is relatively simple and easy to understand. The functionality of this method is to create an entity based on a location and an entity type provided.

## Number of Parameters - 1 Regular[0..3] of method: equals(Object)
We chose to use equals in this metric, which is a widely used method for comparing objects, and within metric evaluations, it is highly rated in several segments.
