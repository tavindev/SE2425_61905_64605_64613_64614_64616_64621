### Author: Gustavo Chevrand
### Code Metrics analyzed: Weighted Methods per Class 
Class: EditSession.java
Value: 397, reference: [0, 12)
With a very high value, compared to the regular value. The EditSession class is very complex in terms of code and understanding.

### Code Metrics analyzed: Condition Nesting Depth
Class: PaperWeight.java

Value: 1. Reference Value: [0, 2[

The code has a low nesting depth, which makes it easier to understand and maintain.

### Code Metrics analyzed: CC Calculation (McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity) - Method Level Value: 10, Regular: [0..3]
Class: LocalSession.java

Method: UpdateServerCUI(Actor actor)

. 
Cyclomatic complexity (CC) is a metric that evaluates the complexity of a method by counting the decision points present in it, such as conditional structures, loops and case statements. The method is rated highly, according to the range. This means that the code has more possible paths, which tends to make it more difficult to understand.
