# Code Metrics Analysis

## RFC Calculation (Chidamber-Kemerer Metrics Set):
- Value collected: 194
- Reference values(Regular): [0..45]
- Extreme range: [80, +âˆž]

- What It Means: Response For a Class (RFC) is a metric that measures the number of methods that can be potentially executed in response to a message received by an object of the class. It includes the methods of the class and any methods that it calls directly.

- What It Indicates: 194 is considerably above the upper reference limit of 45, suggesting that this class has a high number of methods it can invoke. This often indicates high coupling or that the class has too many responsibilities, making it harder to test, understand, and maintain.

## Observations

- Code Quality Issues: The elevated RFC value suggests that this class may be overly complex and dependent on many other classes or methods, leading to potential maintainability and testing issues.

- Improvement Suggestions: Consider refactoring the class to reduce method invocations by delegating responsibilities to other classes, applying the Single Responsibility Principle, and reducing coupling where possible.
