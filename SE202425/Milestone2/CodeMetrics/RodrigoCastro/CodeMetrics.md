## RFC Calculation (Chidamber-Kemerer Metrics Set):
- Value collected: 194
- Reference values(Regular): [0..45]
- Extreme range: [80, +∞]

- What It Means: Response For a Class (RFC) is a metric that measures the number of methods that can be potentially executed in response to a message received by an object of the class. It includes the methods of the class and any methods that it calls directly.

- What It Indicates: 194 is considerably above the upper reference limit of 45, suggesting that this class has a high number of methods it can invoke. This often indicates high coupling or that the class has too many responsibilities, making it harder to test, understand, and maintain.

## Observations

- Code Quality Issues: The elevated RFC value suggests that this class may be overly complex and dependent on many other classes or methods, leading to potential maintainability and testing issues.

- Improvement Suggestions: Consider refactoring the class to reduce method invocations by delegating responsibilities to other classes, applying the Single Responsibility Principle, and reducing coupling where possible.

## NOM Calculation (Li-Henry Metrics Set):
- Value collected: 94
- Reference values (Regular): [0..7]
- Extreme range: [25, +∞]

- What It Means: Number Of Methods (NOM) is a metric that counts the total number of methods defined in a class. This includes both public and private methods and provides insight into the size and potential complexity of the class.

- What It Indicates: A NOM value of 94 significantly exceeds the upper reference limit of 7, indicating that the class has a very high number of methods. This suggests a large, potentially overburdened class, which may be handling too many responsibilities and could be difficult to manage or test effectively.

## Observations
- Code Quality Issues: The high NOM value suggests that the class is likely overloaded with functionality, which can lead to reduced readability, increased maintenance costs, and a higher chance of introducing errors during updates.

- Improvement Suggestions: Refactor the class to distribute functionality across smaller, more cohesive classes. Applying principles such as Single Responsibility and modular design can reduce the method count and improve the class’s maintainability and clarity.
