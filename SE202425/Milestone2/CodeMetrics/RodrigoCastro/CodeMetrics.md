## RFC Calculation (Chidamber-Kemerer Metrics Set) - Class Level:
- Value collected: 194
- Reference values(Regular): [0..45]
- Extreme range: [80, +∞]

- What It Means: Response For a Class (RFC) is a metric that measures the number of methods that can be potentially executed in response to a message received by an object of the class. It includes the methods of the class and any methods that it calls directly.

- What It Indicates: 194 is considerably above the upper reference limit of 45, suggesting that this class has a high number of methods it can invoke. This often indicates high coupling or that the class has too many responsibilities, making it harder to test, understand, and maintain.

## Observations

- Code Quality Issues: The elevated RFC value suggests that this class may be overly complex and dependent on many other classes or methods, leading to potential maintainability and testing issues.

- Improvement Suggestions: Consider refactoring the class to reduce method invocations by delegating responsibilities to other classes, applying the Single Responsibility Principle, and reducing coupling where possible.

## NOM Calculation (Li-Henry Metrics Set) - Class Level:
- Value collected: 94
- Reference values (Regular): [0..7]
- Extreme range: [25, +∞]

- What It Means: Number Of Methods (NOM) is a metric that counts the total number of methods defined in a class. This includes both public and private methods and provides insight into the size and potential complexity of the class.

- What It Indicates: A NOM value of 94 significantly exceeds the upper reference limit of 7, indicating that the class has a very high number of methods. This suggests a large, potentially overburdened class, which may be handling too many responsibilities and could be difficult to manage or test effectively.

## Observations

- Code Quality Issues: The high NOM value suggests that the class is likely overloaded with functionality, which can lead to reduced readability, increased maintenance costs, and a higher chance of introducing errors during updates.

- Improvement Suggestions: Refactor the class to distribute functionality across smaller, more cohesive classes. Applying principles such as Single Responsibility and modular design can reduce the method count and improve the class’s maintainability and clarity.

## CC Calculation (McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity) - Method Level:
- Value collected: 10
- Reference values (Regular): [0..3]
- Extreme range: [7, +∞]
  
- What It Means:
Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) is a metric that quantifies the complexity of a method by counting its decision points, such as conditional statements, loops, and case labels. A higher value indicates more paths through the code, often making it harder to understand, test, and maintain.

- What It Indicates:
The CC value of 10 exceeds both the regular threshold of 3 and the extreme threshold of 7, indicating that this method has multiple branching conditions, resulting in high complexity. This can make it challenging to ensure that all code paths are tested and can hinder readability.

## Observations

- Code Quality Issues:
The high CC value suggests the updateServerCUI method has multiple if statements and nested conditions that increase the branching logic. This complexity can lead to potential issues in understanding and testing, as there are many possible paths to account for.

- Improvement Suggestions:
Consider refactoring the method to reduce the number of conditional checks and nested statements. For instance, splitting logic into smaller, more focused methods or using early returns where possible could simplify the control flow and improve readability.

### Summary
- **Overall Assessment:** Together, these metrics (RFC, NOM, and CC) depict a class that is not only handling too many responsibilities but is also composed of methods with complex internal logic. Refactoring both at the class level (to reduce the number of methods and external dependencies) and within individual methods (to simplify control flow) would help make the code more modular, readable, and maintainable.
