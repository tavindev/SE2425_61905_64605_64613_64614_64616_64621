# Code Metrics Analysis

## Author: Nicolas Nascimento

## Class: BlockState

## RFC Calculation (Chidamber-Kemerer Metrics Set) - Class Level:
- Value collected: 152
- Reference values (Regular): [0..45]
- Extreme range: [80, +∞]

- **What It Means:** Response For a Class (RFC) is a metric that measures the number of methods that can be executed in response to a message received by an object of this class. It accounts for methods within the class itself as well as any methods directly invoked.

- **What It Indicates:** The RFC value of 152 is significantly above the upper reference limit of 45, which indicates high coupling and an extensive number of method interactions. This high RFC may point to multiple responsibilities within the class, making it more challenging to understand, test, and maintain.

## Observations

- **Code Quality Issues:** The high RFC value suggests this class may be overly complex, with excessive dependencies on other methods and classes, which can complicate testing and maintenance.

- **Improvement Suggestions:** Consider refactoring by delegating responsibilities to smaller, more focused classes. Applying the Single Responsibility Principle can help to reduce dependencies and improve code modularity.

## NOM Calculation (Li-Henry Metrics Set) - Class Level:
- Value collected: 87
- Reference values (Regular): [0..7]
- Extreme range: [25, +∞]

- **What It Means:** Number of Methods (NOM) measures the total number of methods within a class, providing an overview of the class's functional size and potential complexity.

- **What It Indicates:** With a NOM of 87, `BlockState` surpasses the standard upper limit of 7 and even the extreme threshold of 25, suggesting it is overloaded with functionality. This large method count can indicate that the class is handling many responsibilities, leading to decreased readability and maintainability.

## Observations

- **Code Quality Issues:** A high number of methods implies that the class may be performing too many tasks, which can reduce clarity and increase the likelihood of errors during modification.

- **Improvement Suggestions:** Consider breaking down the class into smaller, more cohesive components. Using modular design principles, such as the Single Responsibility Principle, can improve readability and maintainability by distributing functionality across smaller classes.

## CC Calculation (McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity) - Method Level:
Method: generateStateMap()
- Value collected: 12
- Reference values (Regular): [0..3]
- Extreme range: [7, +∞]

- **What It Means:** Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) counts the decision points in a method, such as `if` statements, loops, and `switch` cases. Higher values indicate more paths through the code, which can increase difficulty in understanding, testing, and maintaining.

- **What It Indicates:** The CC of 12 in the `generateStateMap` method exceeds both regular and extreme thresholds, showing that it contains numerous conditional branches, making it a highly complex method. This high complexity can make testing challenging as multiple paths must be accounted for.

## Observations

- **Code Quality Issues:** The method's complexity suggests that it includes several conditional and loop constructs, resulting in branching that may obscure its logic.

- **Improvement Suggestions:** Refactor by breaking the method into smaller helper functions to manage complexity. Using early returns or restructuring the flow can also help reduce the number of branches and improve readability.

### Summary
- **Overall Assessment:** The `BlockState` class, with its high RFC, NOM, and individual method complexities, reflects a structure that could benefit greatly from refactoring. Dividing responsibilities among smaller, cohesive classes would improve maintainability, and simplifying control flow within complex methods would enhance readability and testability.
