## Attribute Hiding Factor (AHF) - Class Level:
- **Value collected**: 0,3767
- **Reference values(Regular)**: [0..0.5]

- **What It Means**: The Attribute Hiding Factor quantifies how much of a class’s behavior is encapsulated in its attributes, potentially hiding the class’s internal details. A high value indicates that the class hides its attributes from the outside world, which can reduce transparency.

- **What It Indicates**: A value of 0,3767 suggests that this class moderately hides its attributes. It’s a reasonable level, indicating that the class does not overly expose its internal attributes while still providing necessary access through methods.

## Observations

- **Code Quality Issues**: No immediate issues are apparent. However, in cases where transparency or testing is a priority, the value could be lowered by exposing more attributes directly or via getter/setter methods.

- **Improvement Suggestions**: If the goal is to improve transparency or simplify interactions with the class, consider providing more direct access to critical attributes, or documenting the class’s internal structure better.

## Coupling Factor (CF) - Class Level:
- **Value collected**: 0,0042
- **Reference values(Regular)**: [0..0.1]

- **What It Means**: The Coupling Factor measures the degree of dependency a class has on other classes. A low CF value indicates that the class has fewer external dependencies, which is generally desirable for maintainability.

- **What It Indicates**: A value of 0,0042 is quite low, suggesting that MyClass is well-encapsulated and doesn’t heavily rely on other components of the system. This is a good sign for modularity and ease of maintenance.

## Observations

- **Code Quality Issues**: There are no immediate issues. The low CF indicates good modularity and design, which makes the class easier to modify and test independently.

- **Improvement Suggestions**: Continue to avoid unnecessary dependencies on other classes to maintain the low coupling and modular structure. If any dependencies are introduced, ensure they are essential for the functionality of the class.

## Halstead Difficulty (PRHD) - Method Level:

- **Value collected**: 36872,1395
- **Reference values(Regular)**: [0..50]

- **What It Means**: Halstead Difficulty measures the difficulty of understanding the code based on the number of distinct operators and operands. A high value suggests the code is complex and potentially harder to maintain.

- **What It Indicates**: With a value of 36872,1395, this method is highly complex. The code may involve a large number of unique operations and operands, making it challenging to understand and maintain.

## Observations

- **Code Quality Issues**: The high difficulty suggests that the method might be too intricate, potentially involving many different operations that increase the cognitive load needed to understand the code.

- **Improvement Suggestions**: Refactor the method by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions. By reducing the number of unique operations and improving the method’s clarity, you can make the code easier to maintain and understand.

### Summary
- **Overall Assessment:** The analysis of these metrics indicates that the class exhibits good modularity and low coupling, which are strengths. However, the method could benefit from refactoring due to its high Halstead Difficulty. Reducing the complexity of this method would improve the overall maintainability of the class. Additionally, while the Attribute Hiding Factor is within a reasonable range, further transparency could be considered depending on the specific use case.
