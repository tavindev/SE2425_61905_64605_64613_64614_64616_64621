## Class: Local Session

---

## ATFD (Access To Foreign Data) - Class Level:
- Value collected: 9
- Reference values (Regular): The project median is 1, with the highest value being 36.


- **What It Means:** ATFD measures the number of times a class accesses data from other classes directly. A high ATFD value suggests strong coupling between classes and potential violations of encapsulation, as the class depends heavily on external data.



- **What It Indicates:** An ATFD value of 9 is significantly above the median but not near the maximum for the project. This indicates that LocalSession relies more on accessing foreign data compared to the majority of classes. However, it's not in the range of extreme outliers. This might point to a role as a coordinator or a bridge in the system, but excessive reliance on foreign data could lead to maintenance challenges.

## Observations

- **Improvement Suggestions:** Consider refactoring the class to reduce its dependency on foreign data. This could include:
  Encapsulating frequently accessed data into its own methods or classes.
  Identifying opportunities to introduce interfaces or abstractions to decouple LocalSession from external dependencies.
  Reviewing if some of the accessed data can be passed as parameters instead of being fetched directly.

## CBO (Coupling Between Object classes) - Class Level:
- Value collected: 122
- Reference values (Regular): The project median is 8.9, with the highest value being 267.

- **What It Means:** CBO measures the degree to which a class is coupled to other classes. A high CBO indicates that the class has many dependencies, which can make it harder to modify and more prone to errors when its dependencies change.

- **What It Indicates:** A CBO value of 122 is significantly higher than the project median, showing that LocalSession is strongly coupled with many other classes. This likely stems from its role as a central point of coordination or management in the project, interacting with multiple subsystems. While such coupling is sometimes necessary for core classes, it raises concerns about maintainability and scalability.

## Observations

- **Improvement Suggestions:** Investigate the dependencies to determine if they are all necessary or if some can be removed or consolidated.
  Look for patterns such as God Class tendencies, which could indicate that LocalSession is taking on too many responsibilities.
  Refactor parts of the class to delegate responsibilities to helper classes or modules, reducing direct coupling.
  Introduce dependency injection or interfaces to manage dependencies in a more modular and testable way.

## Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) (McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity) - Method Level:
Method: undo()
- Value collected: 6
- Reference values (Regular): Typical values range from 1 to 10. Values above 10 indicate potentially complex methods.

- **What It Means:** Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) measures the number of independent paths through a methodâ€™s control flow. Each conditional structure (e.g., if, while, for, switch) contributes to the complexity. A higher CC suggests the method has more decision points, making it harder to read, understand, and test.

- **What It Indicates:** A CC value of 6 for the undo method is within acceptable limits but indicates moderate complexity. This means the method has several decision points, likely due to its logic for undoing edits, managing history pointers, and interacting with other components like EditSession and Actor. While manageable, this level of complexity could still pose challenges for new developers or when modifying the method.

## Observations

- **Code Quality Issues:** The method's complexity suggests that it includes several conditional and loop constructs, resulting in branching that may obscure its logic.

- **Improvement Suggestions:** Refactor by breaking the method into smaller helper functions to manage complexity. Using early returns or restructuring the flow can also help reduce the number of branches and improve readability.

### Summary
- **Overall Assessment:** The metrics suggest that LocalSession plays a critical role in the project but at the cost of high coupling and reliance on foreign data. While these characteristics might be expected in a management or coordination class, they also present risks for long-term maintainability and flexibility. Addressing these issues through thoughtful refactoring and better encapsulation can help improve the class's robustness and adaptability.
