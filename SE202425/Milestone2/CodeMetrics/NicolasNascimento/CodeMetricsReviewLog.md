### Code Metrics analyzed: Number of Parameters in Method
### Author: Gustavo Chevrand

- **Analysis Summary**: The method `fillXZ` has 5 parameters, which exceeds the typical range of [0..3) for maintainable design. This indicates a high level of complexity and increases the cognitive load for developers, as they must remember each parameter’s purpose and order. The numerous parameters could lead to potential usability issues and testing challenges.

- **Suggestions**: To improve maintainability, consider refactoring by grouping related parameters into objects or reducing the number of parameters where feasible. This would enhance readability and reduce the risk of parameter-related errors.

### Code Metrics analyzed: Cognitive Complexity Calculation
### Author: Lucas Tobias

- **Analysis Summary**: The method `createEntity` has a cognitive complexity of 4, well within the acceptable range of [0..8), indicating straightforward logic. The low complexity suggests the method is simple to understand and maintain, with minimal control flow intricacies.

- **Suggestions**: The method’s simplicity aligns well with its function. No immediate refactoring is necessary; however, maintaining this level of simplicity is advisable to ensure readability as the method evolves.

### Code Metrics analyzed: NOM Calculation (Li-Henry Metrics Set) - Class Level
### Author: Rodrigo Castro

- **Analysis Summary**: The class analyzed has a NOM of 94, far exceeding the regular threshold of 7 and the extreme range of 25. This indicates that the class likely has too many responsibilities, leading to decreased readability and higher maintenance demands.

- **Suggestions**: Refactor by distributing functionality across smaller, more cohesive classes. Applying the Single Responsibility Principle would reduce method count, simplify maintenance, and improve code modularity.
