### RFC Calculation (Chidamber-Kemerer Metrics Set) - Class Level

- **Value Collected:** 24
    
- **Reference Values (Regular):** [0..45]
    
- **Extreme Range:** [80, +∞]
    
- **Explanation:** Response for a Class (RFC) measures the number of methods that can potentially be executed in response to a message received by an object of the class. This metric includes methods within the class and any methods directly invoked.
    
- **Interpretation:** An RFC value of 24 is within the normal reference range, suggesting that the class has a reasonable number of potential method invocations. This typically indicates that the class has a manageable level of complexity and does not exhibit excessive coupling or responsibility.
    

#### Observations

- **Code Quality Observations:** The RFC value suggests that this class’s level of complexity and coupling is controlled and manageable.
- **Improvement Suggestions:** Although the RFC is within a regular range, continual monitoring of method invocations can help ensure the class remains maintainable. Delegating complex responsibilities to helper classes when necessary is a good practice.

### NOM Calculation (Li-Henry Metrics Set) - Class Level

- **Value Collected:** 24
    
- **Reference Values (Regular):** [0..7]
    
- **Extreme Range:** [25, +∞]
    
- **Explanation:** Number of Methods (NOM) counts the total number of methods defined in a class, including both public and private methods. This provides insight into the class’s size and potential complexity.
    
- **Interpretation:** A NOM value of 24 exceeds the typical upper limit of 7, indicating that the class has a high number of methods. This suggests that the class may be handling multiple responsibilities, which could make it harder to test and maintain.
    

#### Observations

- **Code Quality Issues:** The high NOM value indicates that the class may be overloaded with functionality, reducing readability and increasing maintenance complexity.
- **Improvement Suggestions:** Refactor the class to break down functionality into smaller, more focused classes. Following the Single Responsibility Principle and modular design practices can help distribute responsibilities and reduce method count.

### CC Calculation (McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity) - Method Level

**Method:** `butcherBrush(Player player, LocalSession session)`

- **Value Collected:** 3
    
- **Reference Values (Regular):** [0..3]
    
- **Extreme Range:** [7, +∞]
    
- **Explanation:** Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) quantifies the complexity of a method by counting its decision points, such as conditional statements and loops. Higher values indicate a more complex control flow.
    
- **Interpretation:** With a CC value of 3, this method is within the typical range, suggesting that its logic is straightforward and manageable.
    

#### Observations

- **Code Quality Observations:** The method's complexity appears to be manageable, with minimal branching logic.
- **Improvement Suggestions:** No immediate action required, but regularly reviewing for added complexity can help maintain readability.

### Summary

- **Overall Assessment:** These metrics (RFC, NOM, and CC) collectively depict a class that could benefit from some refactoring, especially concerning the number of methods. While the RFC and CC metrics are within acceptable ranges, the high NOM value indicates that the class may be overextended in responsibilities. Refactoring to distribute functionality across smaller, cohesive classes could improve readability, modularity, and maintainability.
