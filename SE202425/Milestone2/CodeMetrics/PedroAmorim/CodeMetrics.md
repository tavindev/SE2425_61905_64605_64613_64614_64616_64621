### RFC Calculation (Chidamber-Kemerer Metrics Set) - Class Level

- **Value Collected:** 24
    
- **Reference Values (Regular):** [0..45]
    
- **Extreme Range:** [80, +∞]
    
- **Explanation:** Response for a Class (RFC) measures the number of methods that can potentially be executed in response to a message received by an object of the class. This metric includes methods within the class and any methods directly invoked.
    
- **Interpretation:** An RFC value of 24 is within the normal reference range, suggesting that the class has a reasonable number of potential method invocations. This typically indicates that the class has a manageable level of complexity and does not exhibit excessive coupling or responsibility.
    

#### Observations

- **Code Quality Observations:** The RFC value suggests that this class’s level of complexity and coupling is controlled and manageable.
- **Improvement Suggestions:** Although the RFC is within a regular range, continual monitoring of method invocations can help ensure the class remains maintainable. Delegating complex responsibilities to helper classes when necessary is a good practice.

### WMC Calculation (Weighted Methods per Class)

- **Value Collected:** 41
    
- **Reference Values (Regular):** [0..12]
    
- **Extreme Range:** [25, +∞]
    
- **Explanation:** Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) measures the complexity of a class by summing the cyclomatic complexity of all its methods. Higher values indicate higher overall complexity within the class, which may suggest a higher likelihood of faults and maintenance difficulties.
    
- **Interpretation:** A WMC value of 41 significantly exceeds the regular threshold of 12, suggesting that the class may be complex and potentially overloaded with functionality. High WMC values often imply that the class contains numerous branches and decision points, making it harder to understand, test, and maintain.
    

#### Observations

- **Code Quality Issues:** The high WMC value indicates that the class has complex functionality, which can reduce readability, complicate testing, and increase maintenance requirements.
- **Improvement Suggestions:** Refactoring the class to break down complex methods and distribute functionality across smaller, cohesive classes can reduce the WMC value. Applying the Single Responsibility Principle and modular design can further help manage complexity.

### LOC Calculation (Lines of Code) - Method Level

**Method:** `butcherBrush(Player player, LocalSession session)`

- **Value Collected:** 57
    
- **Reference Values (Regular):** [0..11]
    
- **Extreme Range:** [25, +∞]
    
- **Explanation:** Lines of Code (LOC) measures the length of a method, which is often correlated with complexity. Longer methods are typically harder to read, understand, and maintain. Excessive LOC may indicate that the method is handling too much logic.
    
- **Interpretation:** With a LOC value of 57, this method exceeds the typical threshold of 11 and is even beyond the extreme limit of 25. This indicates that the method may be too lengthy, potentially including several branches or responsibilities within a single function.
    

#### Observations

- **Code Quality Issues:** The high LOC value suggests that the `butcherBrush` method might be performing multiple tasks, which can make it challenging to test, debug, and maintain.
- **Improvement Suggestions:** Consider refactoring the `butcherBrush` method to split its logic into smaller, more focused methods, each handling a distinct responsibility. This approach can improve readability and simplify the method’s control flow.

### Summary

- **Overall Assessment:** These metrics (RFC, WMC, and LOC) together suggest that while the class’s response complexity (RFC) is within an acceptable range, its overall complexity (WMC) and the length of specific methods (LOC) are higher than recommended. Refactoring the class to reduce method size and complexity, particularly by dividing complex methods into smaller ones and distributing responsibilities across additional classes, would improve readability, modularity, and maintainability.
