### Metrics Collected

Class: PaperWeightAdapter.java

Class Level

### 1. Number of Overridden Methods (Lorenz-Kidd Metric Set):

- **What It Means:**
  The Number of Overridden Methods metric refers to the count of methods in a class that override methods from a superclass or interface.

- Value collected: 13 

- Reference values (Regular): [0..3[

- Extreme range: [5, +∞]

- Average NOOM in project: 0.9730

- **What It Indicates:**
  The Number of Overridden Methods (NOOM) value for this class is 13, which is significantly above both the project average of 0.9730 and the extreme range threshold of [5, ∞). This highlights the class as an outlier in terms of overridden methods compared to the rest of the codebase.

---

### Observations
- **Code Quality Issues:** The high **NOOM** value suggests that the class might be over-reliant on inheritance, potentially violating design principles like the Liskov Substitution Principle. It may also indicate that the class is part of a complex or deeply nested inheritance hierarchy.
- **Maintainability Concerns:** A high number of overridden methods can increase the likelihood of errors and make the codebase harder to understand, test, and extend.

## Improvement Suggestions
- **Simplify Inheritance:** Review the class hierarchy to ensure it is necessary and does not excessively rely on overriding methods.
- **Use Composition:** Replace inheritance with composition where appropriate to reduce dependency on parent classes.
- **Abstract Classes or Interfaces:** Reevaluate if the parent class or interface design can be simplified to reduce the need for overriding.

### 2. Number of Attributes (Lorenz-Kidd Metric Set)

- **What It Means:**
  The Number of Attributes (NOA) metric represents the count of attributes (fields or member variables) declared in a class.

- Value collected: 11

- Reference values (Regular): [0..4[

- Extreme range: [15, +∞]

- Average NOA in project: 16.8119

- **What It Indicates:**
  The **NOA** value of 11 for this class is below the project average and well within acceptable limits, indicating that this class is not overly attribute-heavy compared to others in the codebase. This suggests that it is likely more maintainable and adheres to good design principles.

---

### Observations
- **Code Quality Issues:**  A moderate **NOA** value suggests the class is reasonably well-structured and avoids excessive complexity.
- **Maintainability:** The class is less likely to face issues like being overly complex, hard to test, or tightly coupled to specific functionalities.

## Improvement Suggestions
- **Monitor Growth:** Ensure that the attribute count does not increase significantly, as this could indicate a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle or lead to poor maintainability.
- **Encapsulation:** Keep attributes private and provide access through methods to maintain abstraction and control over changes.

Method Level 

### 3. Condition Nesting Depth

- **What It Means:** The Condition Nested Depth metric measures how many levels of nested conditional or loop statements exist in code. Higher depth indicates increased complexity, making the code harder to read, test, and maintain.

- **What It Indicates:** The Condition Nested Depth value of 1 for this section of code falls comfortably within the acceptable range of [0, 2[. This indicates that the nesting of conditional or loop statements is minimal, suggesting the code is simple and easy to follow.

- Value collected: 1

- Reference values (Regular): [0..2[

---

### Observations
- **Code Quality Issues:** The low Condition Nested Depth reflects well on the code’s maintainability and readability, minimizing risks associated with deep nesting, such as reduced clarity and increased debugging complexity.

- **Improvement Suggestions:** While the current nesting depth is optimal, it’s important to maintain this simplicity as the code evolves. Monitor future changes to ensure new logic does not introduce excessive nesting.
