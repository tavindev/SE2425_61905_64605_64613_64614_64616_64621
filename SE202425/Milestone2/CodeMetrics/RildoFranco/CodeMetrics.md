### Metrics Collected

Class: PaperWeightAdapter.java

Class Level

### 1. Cognitive Complexity Calculation (G. Ann Metrics Set):
Value collected: 98, Reference values: [0..32[

- **What It Means:**
Cognitive complexity is a measure of how difficult a piece of code is to understand. It takes into account various factors such as the number of nested loops, conditionals, and other control flow structures. A higher value indicates more complex code.

- **What It Indicates:**
Value 98: This value is significantly higher than the upper reference value of 32. This indicates that the code is highly complex and likely difficult to understand and maintain.

---

### Observations
- **Code Quality Issues:** The high cognitive complexity value suggests that the code may have several nested loops, conditionals, or other control flow structures that make it difficult to read and understand and maintain.

- **Improvement Suggestions:** Refactor to reduce nesting, simplify control flow, break down large functions, and use descriptive variable and function names to improve readability.

---

### Summary
- **Overall Assessment:** The code's cognitive complexity value of 98 is significantly higher than the acceptable range of 0 to 32. This suggests the code is overly complex and requires refactoring to improve readability and maintainability.


### 2. Response For A Class (Chidamber-Kemerer Metrics Set):
Value collected: 361, Reference: [0, 45[

- **What It Means:**
Response For A Class (RFC) measures the number of methods that can be executed in response to a message received by an object of that class. It includes all methods that can be invoked directly or indirectly as a result of a message.

- **What It Indicates:**
Value 361: This value is significantly higher than the upper reference value of 45. This indicates that the class has a large number of methods that can be called, suggesting it is highly coupled and complex.

---

### Observations
- **Code Quality Issues:** The high RFC value suggests that the class may have too many responsibilities, making it difficult to understand and maintain.

- **Improvement Suggestions:** Apply the Single Responsibility Principle to ensure each class has one responsibility, break down the class into smaller, more focused classes.

---

### Summary
- **Overall Assessment:** The Response For A Class value of 361 is significantly higher than the acceptable range of 0 to 45. This indicates the class is overly complex and highly coupled, making it difficult to maintain. Refactoring the class to reduce the number of methods and applying design principles can improve code quality.


Method Level 

### 3. Condition Nesting Depth 
Value: 1, Reference Value: [0, 2[

- **What It Means:** Condition Nesting Depth measures the maximum depth of nested conditional statements (e.g., if-else, switch-case) in the code. It indicates how deeply nested the control flow is within the code.

- **What It Indicates:**  This value is within the acceptable range of 0 to 2. It indicates that the code has a shallow nesting depth, which is generally good for readability and maintainability.

---

### Observations
- **Code Quality Issues:** No significant issues related to condition nesting depth.

- **Improvement Suggestions:** Maintain the current level of nesting depth to ensure the code remains readable and maintainable.

---

### Summary
- **Overall Assessment:** The Condition Nesting Depth value of 1 falls within the acceptable range of 0 to 2. This suggests that the code has minimal nesting, which enhances readability and maintainability. No immediate changes are necessary.
