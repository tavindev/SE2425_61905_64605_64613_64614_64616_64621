### Use Case: Ascend Levels
### Author: Lucas Tobias

### General Comments
- **Clarity**: The use case is straightforward, and the description is concise. However, specifying more detail about the platform’s function or how it is defined could make the purpose of ascending more explicit for players and developers.
- **Completeness**: The primary and secondary actors are appropriately listed, and the description aligns with the expected functionality.

### Specific Comments
- **Preconditions:** Adding a precondition about floor availability would clarify what happens when the player is on the highest level.
- **Postconditions:** It would be beneficial to state that the player’s position is updated and saved at the new level.
- **Alternative Flows:** Consider an alternative flow for when the target level is obstructed or inaccessible.


### Conclusion
- **Final Thoughts:** This use case is clear but could benefit from additional details in the preconditions and alternative flows to cover boundary scenarios.

### Use Case: Descend Levels
### Author: Lucas Tobias

### General Comments
- Clarity: The purpose of this use case is clear, though a brief explanation about how floors are structured in the environment would be useful.
- Consistency: The flow aligns well with the corresponding “Ascend Levels” use case, maintaining consistent structure.

### Specific Comments
- Preconditions: Similar to “Ascend Levels,” a precondition about floor availability (i.e., not being on the lowest level) would add clarity.
- Alternative Flows: Mentioning what happens if there is an obstacle on the destination floor could enhance the understanding of potential limitations.
### Conclusion
- **Final Thoughts:** This use case is easy to understand but could be improved by addressing scenarios for when the target floor is unavailable or obstructed.

### Use Case: Copy region
### Author: Gustavo Chevrand

### General Comments

- Clarity: The description is very clear, and the actions taken by the player and system are well-defined.
-	Accuracy: The steps align with expected clipboard functionalities in similar applications, making it intuitive.

### Specific Comments

- 	Alternative Flows: Adding an alternative flow for what happens if there is already content in the clipboard could clarify clipboard overwrite behavior.
-    Postconditions: Mentioning whether or not the copied content is retained after the player logs out might be helpful for long-term storage implications.

### Conclusion
- **Final Thoughts:** This use case is strong and comprehensive. Small clarifications on clipboard management could enhance it even further.

### Use Case: Restore Snapshot
### Author: Rildo Franco

### General Comments

- Clarity: The description provides a solid understanding of the restore process, making it clear what the expected outcome is.
- Completeness: The use case is complete, covering both actors and actions in sufficient detail.

### Specific Comments

- 	Alternative Flows: Including an alternative flow in case of an unsuccessful restore (e.g., corrupted snapshot) would account for potential issues.
-    Preconditions: A note on permissions required to access snapshots could be helpful for understanding restrictions.

### Conclusion
- **Final Thoughts:** This is a well-documented use case that could be even more robust with scenarios for errors during the restoration process.

### Use Case: Create Hollow Cylinder (hcyl)
### Author: Rodrigo Castro

### General Comments

- Clarity: The purpose and functionality of this use case are clear, especially for players familiar with similar construction tools.
-    Precision: The parameters of radius and height are specified, making it straightforward for implementation.

### Specific Comments

- Preconditions: Including a precondition specifying if the player needs edit permissions for the area would be helpful.
- Alternative Flows: An alternative flow for what happens if the area is obstructed (e.g., by other structures) could add depth.

### Conclusion
- **Final Thoughts:** This use case is well-documented, and a few additional conditions would make it even more comprehensive.
