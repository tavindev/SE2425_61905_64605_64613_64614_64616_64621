# 1. Adapter

## Reviewer: Nicolas Nascimento

### General Comments
- The use of the Adapter pattern in PaperWeightServerLevelDelegateProxy and PaperWeightAdapter is appropriate, as it enables compatibility between WorldEdit and Minecraft’s internal structures by adapting types and data.



### Specific Comments
- **Adapter Implementation**: PaperWeightServerLevelDelegateProxy effectively serves as an Adapter, transforming EditSession calls into Minecraft-compatible methods. Its methods, like getBlockEntity, getBlockState, and setBlock, use PaperWeightAdapter to convert WorldEdit data into Minecraft-native structures.
- **Complex Data Adaptation**: In fromNative within PaperWeightAdapter, complex Minecraft data types (e.g., CompoundTag, ByteTag) are efficiently adapted, which exemplifies the Adapter pattern’s role in handling diverse data types for compatibility.
- **Error handling in setBlock**: Exception handling in setBlock is suitable but could improve with additional context. Alternatively, using a custom exception type could make adapter errors clearer.
- **Coupling**: Though effective, a possible improvement could involve introducing an interface for PaperWeightAdapter to reduce coupling and facilitate future adaptations.

### Conclusion
- **Final Thoughts:** This review correctly identifies the Adapter pattern and its effective use in facilitating compatibility. Small adjustments to error handling and decoupling could enhance flexibility, but the implementation solidly demonstrates the Adapter pattern’s intended purpose.

# 2. Prototype

### General Comments
- The use of the Prototype pattern in EditSessionEvent is appropriate, especially in cases where similar event instances with minor variations are frequently required. The pattern is implemented clearly, with the clone method allowing for efficient duplication with customizable properties.



### Specific Comments
- **Efficient Cloning**: The clone(Stage stage) method enables the creation of a new EditSessionEvent instance while reusing existing properties, which can improve performance and reduce redundant object construction when only a slight variation (i.e., Stage) is needed.
- **Simplification of Object Creation**: By allowing EditSessionEvent instances to be cloned with a modified Stage, the Prototype pattern simplifies the process of creating similar events without duplicating code, making the event handling more adaptable.
- **Customizability**: The stage parameter in the clone method is a smart choice for flexibility, allowing variations in event stages without affecting other properties, which makes the EditSessionEvent class more modular and adaptable.

### Conclusion
- **Final Thoughts:** The Prototype pattern is effectively applied here, with the clone method providing a straightforward approach to creating event variations. This design is a good fit for scenarios needing frequent but minor adjustments, enhancing reusability and maintainability.

# 3. Composite

## Reviewer: Nicolas Nascimento

### General Comments
- The Composite pattern is well-suited for MaskIntersection2D, as it allows multiple Mask2D objects to be grouped and managed as a single, cohesive entity. This design supports flexibility and simplifies complex mask operations by treating each mask uniformly.



### Specific Comments
- **Effective Composition**: The masks set efficiently holds multiple Mask2D instances, enabling MaskIntersection2D to iterate over each mask and apply the same test operation. This approach showcases the Composite pattern’s strength in unifying and simplifying the use of multiple objects.
- **Clear Implementation of Composite Logic**: The test method correctly applies intersection logic by returning false if any mask’s test method fails. This implementation is clear and efficient, following Composite principles to aggregate results from individual Mask2D components.
- **Potential for Extendability**: With the masks collection, additional Mask2D elements can be added easily, allowing for further customization and scalability of mask combinations, making the Composite design highly adaptable.

### Conclusion
- **Final Thoughts**: The Composite pattern is applied effectively in MaskIntersection2D, enabling a structured, cohesive way to handle multiple masks. This design approach promotes code simplicity and flexibility, aligning well with the requirements for complex 2D mask operations.
