### General Comments
- The code smells report provides a detailed identification of potential issues in the `actPrimary` method in `AreaPickaxe.java`. Specifically, the report recognizes the "Long Parameter List" code smell, which may decrease code readability and maintainability by making the method harder to understand at a glance.

### Specific Comments
- **Long Parameter List:** The `actPrimary` method currently accepts six parameters, which is on the higher side and can make the method challenging to work with. The solution proposes removing the `face` parameter since it is unused, which is a good start for reducing the parameter count. 

- **Consistency Check:** Once the `face` parameter is removed, check for other methods or places where `actPrimary` is called to ensure consistency across the codebase.

### Conclusion
- **Final Thoughts:** The proposed solution addresses the immediate issue by removing the unused `face` parameter, which simplifies the parameter list. Future considerations could include further refactoring to encapsulate related parameters into objects where logical. Overall, addressing this code smell will likely improve the codeâ€™s readability and maintainability.
