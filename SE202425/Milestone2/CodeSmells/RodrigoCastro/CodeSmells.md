### Identified Code Smells
The code smells identified and the location, what's the issue.

### 1. Speculative Generality
- location: worldedit-core/src/main/java/com/sk89q/worldedit/scripting/CraftScriptEnvironment.java and worldedit-core/src/main/java/com/sk89q/worldedit/scripting/CraftScriptContext.java
  

- The CraftScriptEnvironment class is marked as abstract but currently has only one concrete subclass, CraftScriptContext. The existence of a single subclass suggests that CraftScriptEnvironment may be over-generalized or created with speculative future use cases in mind that have not materialized.

```java
public abstract class CraftScriptEnvironment {

    protected WorldEdit controller;
    protected Player player;
    protected LocalConfiguration config;
    protected LocalSession session;
    protected Platform server;

    public CraftScriptEnvironment(WorldEdit controller, Platform server, LocalConfiguration config, LocalSession session, Player player) {
        this.controller = controller;
        this.player = player;
        this.config = config;
        this.server = server;
        this.session = session;
    }

}
```
## Solution:
Merge CraftScriptEnvironment and CraftScriptContext if thereâ€™s no foreseeable subclassing.

### 2. Data Class
- Location: worldedit-core/src/main/java/com/sk89q/worldedit/history/UndoContext.java

- This class only contains:
A single Extent field.
A getter and setter for extent.
Without any additional behavior, it essentially serves as a passive data holder.

```java
public class UndoContext {

    private Extent extent;

    /**
     * Get the extent set on this context.
     *
     * @return an extent or null
     */
    public @Nullable Extent getExtent() {
        return extent;
    }

    /**
     * Set the extent on this context.
     *
     * @param extent an extent or null
     */
    public void setExtent(@Nullable Extent extent) {
        this.extent = extent;
    }
}
```
## Solution: 
To improve UndoContext, could be added meaningful methods to encapsulate behavior related to extent, particularly around how it should interact with undo/redo operations.
