### Identified Code Smells
The code smells identified and the location, what's the issue.

### 1. Speculative Generality
- location: worldedit-core/src/main/java/com/sk89q/worldedit/scripting/CraftScriptEnvironment.java and worldedit-core/src/main/java/com/sk89q/worldedit/scripting/CraftScriptContext.java
  

- The CraftScriptEnvironment class is marked as abstract but currently has only one concrete subclass, CraftScriptContext. The existence of a single subclass suggests that CraftScriptEnvironment may be over-generalized or created with speculative future use cases in mind that have not materialized.

```java
public abstract class CraftScriptEnvironment {

    protected WorldEdit controller;
    protected Player player;
    protected LocalConfiguration config;
    protected LocalSession session;
    protected Platform server;

    public CraftScriptEnvironment(WorldEdit controller, Platform server, LocalConfiguration config, LocalSession session, Player player) {
        this.controller = controller;
        this.player = player;
        this.config = config;
        this.server = server;
        this.session = session;
    }

}
```
## Solution:
Merge CraftScriptEnvironment and CraftScriptContext if thereâ€™s no foreseeable subclassing.
