### Large Class
Class `FabricDataFixer` in the path
worldedit-fabric/src/main/java/com/sk89q/worldedit/fabric/FabricDataFixer.java, the class has 2764 lines.

### Solution
Refactor the class. With a very large class its complexity is greater, I would delegate some actions to other classes to reduce its complexity and a better understanding of the class.
